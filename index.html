			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src = "blueunderline.png" class = "underline">
			<p>Hello! My name is Nishant Chintala (you can call me Nish). I am a sophomore at the University of Delaware, studying Computer Science and Finance. </p>
			<img src = "aboutmepic.jpeg" class = "pic">
			<p>I strive to be a student leader on campus and inspire my peers to step out of their comfort zones and try new things (just as I did in my first year). Doing so allowed me to recognize some of my new interests, like playing ultimate frisbee, analyzing stocks, and learning about entrepreneurship. Hopefully, I can take all of my life experiences and put it towards achieving my goal of starting my own business.</p>
		</div>

		<div id = "education">
			<h1>Education</h1>
			<img src = "greenunderline.png" class = "underline">
			<p>I study at the University of Delaware (Go Blue Hens!) and am currently in my second year. I am majoring in Computer Science and Finance (hold on, I'll get to it).</p>
			<img src = "udel.jpg" class = "udel-pic">
			<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
			<p class = "why-compsci">I have always liked puzzles. As a kid, I enjoyed solving, 100, 200, even 1000 piece puzzles with my dad, mom, and brother. I liked how the pieces fit together, each piece having an impact on the final picture. Get one piece wrong and the entire final picture is incorrect.<br><br>Computer Science is very similar. Each small variable, method, class, or object plays a role in the end functionality of the program. When I code, I think of how each aspect of the program serves a purpose in terms of getting the anticipated end result. My brain simply works like that, connecting every small detail to the big picture. And, just like that, a young kid who loved doing puzzles became a computer scientist.</p>

			<h2>Why Finance?</h2>
			<p class = "why-fin">Many people have great ideas. However, why is it so often that those ideas get lost due to fear of starting a business or the lack of knowledge on how to start one? It may take an engineer to make the product, but it takes a businessman/woman to sell it.<br>I realized this and thought "what's stopping me from taking on both fields?" I chose finance because of my interest with handling and managing assets and my newfound interest in the stock market. Hopefully, somewhere down the road, I can use my computer science knowledge to create a product and my finance knowledge to give it to the world.</p>
